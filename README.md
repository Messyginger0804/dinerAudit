# DinerFinder - A Restaurant Review Application

Welcome to DinerFinder, an application that acts as a restaurant review site, allowing users to write and share reviews, rate restaurants on a star scale, and provide price ratings on a 1-5 scale. The front end of DinerFinder is built using Vite, React, and styled with Tailwind CSS, while the back end is powered by Node.js and PostgreSQL. Throughout this project, [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) has been used to interact with the PostgreSQL database. DinerFinder is currently an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), and there are plans to expand the project, including adding user profiles and enhancing the user interface.
